## About 👋

Ardaku is a free-form organization made of entirely volunteers created with the goal of empowering people to use computers more enjoyably and efficiently.

## Contribution Guidelines 🌈

Opening issues has no hard guidelines, and is appreciated.
Commenting on an issue off-topic will be followed by a warning, and deletion of the comment.
Any kind of harassment will lead to the offender being blocked from contributing.
Preëxisting issues are not required for opening a PR.
Open a PR for each change you wish to submit.
All PRs will be merged with the squash-and-merge method.
Don't hesitate to reach out to me at <aldaronlau@gmail.com> if you don't feel that you can contribute, or you don't feel welcomed, and I'll try to make it better.
